There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes, a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks, he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire
**Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen**
There was a cat that really was gone
**Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine**
It was a shame how he carried on (on, on)
